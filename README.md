**Alloy Phase Analyzer** is a Python-based application developed to assist researchers, students, and engineers in analyzing alloy phase diagrams and performing key calculations such as phase fractions using the Lever Rule and Tie-Line methods. This project is designed to simplify material science computations by providing an intuitive and automated solution for analyzing binary alloy systems such as Pb-Sn, Fe-C, and Cu-Ni. With a user-friendly interface, the application guides users through the process of selecting phase diagrams, inputting alloy compositions and temperatures, and calculating phase compositions and fractions based on predefined temperature ranges or interpolation methods.  

A standout feature of the Alloy Phase Analyzer is its capability to generate detailed PDF reports dynamically. These reports include user inputs, computed phase compositions and fractions, and embedded phase diagram images, offering a comprehensive analysis in a professional format. The application also automatically names the reports based on user inputs, such as composition, temperature, and selected alloy system, ensuring easy organization and retrieval.  

Built using Python, the project leverages libraries like NumPy for numerical calculations and ReportLab for PDF generation, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. The modular design of the Alloy Phase Analyzer allows for the easy addition of new alloy systems and customization of phase data, making it scalable for diverse applications. Whether for educational purposes, research, or industrial alloy design, the Alloy Phase Analyzer provides a powerful tool for streamlining the analysis of alloy phase diagrams, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications.
