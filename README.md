# Alloy-Phase-Analyzer-using-Python
**Alloy Phase Analyzer** is a Python-based tool for analyzing alloy phase diagrams like Pb-Sn, Fe-C, and Cu-Ni. It computes phase fractions using the Lever Rule and generates dynamic PDF reports with user inputs, phase compositions, and diagrams. Scalable and efficient, it simplifies material science analysis.
